Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems
Software engineering is important in the technology industry as it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The 3 milestones include
Development of programming languages such as Fortran and C
The rise og agile methodologies in the 2000s.
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The SDLC has the following phass
Requirements- involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design- creating a high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation- writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing- involves conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment- releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance-providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with different phases such a requirements, design, implementation flowing downwards like a waterfall while Agile is Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer- is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer-ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager-oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code e.g. Visual Studio and Eclipse.
Version Control Systems is also important  as it helps track changes to source code and helps coordinate work among team membersa and they include Git and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

The challenges software engineers encounter include
Changing requirements- requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep ad project delays.
Tight deadlines- pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality
Technical debt- accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
To overcome the challenges the following strategies should be put in place, that is effective communication, prioritization of tasks, agile methodologies, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit-involves testing individual components or modules of software
Integration- testing interactions between different components or subsystems
System- testing the entire software system as a whole
Acceptance â€“ testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. It is important in interacting with AI models as it helps in making questions clear and specific so the AI understands exactly what you need.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

A vague prompt includes Universities in Kenya
a specific and a clear should be something like list all universities in Kenya

Improved prompt is more effective because the AI gets to understand exactly what you need.
